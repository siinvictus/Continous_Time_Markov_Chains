# Continous_Time_Markov_Chains
This project was conducted for my master's studies in network dynamics. The goal was to simulate dynamic processes on networks, focusing on continuous-time Markov Chains and their statistical properties, while analyzing metrics and comparing simulation results with theoretical calculations.
